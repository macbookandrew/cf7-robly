Adds Contact Form 7 submission information to one or more Robly lists, including custom fields.

== Description ==

[Robly](https://www.robly.com/) is a paid email marketing service provider that helps you send emails to large numbers of people at once and allows contacts to be in multiple lists for targeted marketing purposes. Using Robly’s API, this plugin adds Contact Form 7 submissions to one or more Robly lists, including custom fields.

This plugin requires an active Robly account as well as Contact Form 7. You’ll also need to <a href="mailto:support@robly.com?subject=API access">contact Robly support</a> to get an API ID and key for your account.

== Installation ==

1. Upload this folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install from the Plugins menu in WordPress.
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Settings > CF7 to Robly in WordPress, enter your Robly API ID and key, and save the settings.
1. On each of your Contact Form 7 forms, go to the “Robly Settings” tab and specify the list(s) you would like to add submissions to, as well as specifying the form fields and Robly data fields. Save the contact form.
1. If you need advanced list handling (adding contacts to specific lists based on which checkboxes are active, etc.):
	1. Add a hidden field named `robly_lists`: `[hidden robly-lists]`
	1. Get the ID numbers of the appropriate lists from Robly: go to <a href="https://app.robly.com/email/lists/summary" target="_blank">lists summary</a> and click on a list. The URL will have a `value` paramater with the ID field you need (example: https://app.robly.com/email/contacts?lookup_type=sub_list&value=<strong>11111</strong>)
	1. Use Javascript on the frontend to watch for changes and dynamically set the `robly_lists` field value to a comma-separated list of the Robly list IDs
	1. For an example, look in the plugin folder at <a href="https://github.com/macbookandrew/cf7-robly/blob/master/js/advanced-checkboxes.js">js/advanced-checkboxes.js</a>

You are then able to choose certain lists to which contact form submissions are added, and those choices are saved in your WordPress options.
1. When somebody submits a contact form, WordPress will contact the Robly API and search for that email address in your Robly account. If found, it will update their information according to the settings you specified; otherwise, it will create a new contact with the contact information and add them to the list(s) you selected.

= I have a hard-coded HTML field and it doesn’t show up in the list of fields; what do I do? =
